# Final-DUTstination

*Saving good Devices Under Test (DUTs) from their falsely predicted final destination!*

## Project Overview

This repository contains the research project code for developing and evaluating machine learning models (MLP and Random Forest) to predict the likelihood of a failed Automated Test Equipment (ATE) result being a **False Positive** for a specific type of PCB (DUT). The goal is to provide actionable insights to production operatives, helping them decide the best next step (e.g., retest, send to rework) rather than automatically trusting potentially misleading ATE failure flags.
